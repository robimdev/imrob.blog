## Connecting the NRF24 module to the Flipper Zero

The NRF24 module can be connected to the Flipper Zero in a few simple steps. First, you will need to solder the NRF24 module to the Flipper Zero board. The pins are labeled on the module, and you can find the pinout diagram in the Flipper Zero documentation.

Once the NRF24 module is soldered to the board, you will need to connect it to the power and ground pins on the Flipper Zero. The power pin is labeled VCC, and the ground pin is labeled GND.

Once the NRF24 module is connected to the power and ground pins, you can connect it to the Flipper Zero's serial port. The serial port is labeled TX and RX, and it is located on the back of the board.

## Opening the NRF24 Sniffer

The NRF24 Sniffer is a program that allows you to view the data that is being transmitted by the NRF24 module. To open the NRF24 Sniffer, you will need to connect the NRF24 module to your computer and then open the program.

Once the NRF24 Sniffer is open, you will need to select the correct port. The port is usually labeled COM1 or COM2, and it is located in the settings menu.

## Scanning channels and modes

The NRF24 module can be used to transmit and receive data on a variety of channels and modes. To scan the channels and modes, you will need to use the NRF24 Sniffer.

To scan the channels, you will need to click on the "Scan" button. The NRF24 Sniffer will then scan the channels and show you a list of the channels that are available.

To scan the modes, you will need to click on the "Modes" button. The NRF24 Sniffer will then scan the modes and show you a list of the modes that are available.

## Using the NRF24 Mouse Jacker

The NRF24 Mouse Jacker is a program that allows you to use the NRF24 module to control a mouse. To use the NRF24 Mouse Jacker, you will need to connect the NRF24 module to your computer and then open the program.

Once the NRF24 Mouse Jacker is open, you will need to select the correct port. The port is usually labeled COM1 or COM2, and it is located in the settings menu.

Once the correct port is selected, you will need to click on the "Start" button. The NRF24 Mouse Jacker will then start controlling the mouse.
